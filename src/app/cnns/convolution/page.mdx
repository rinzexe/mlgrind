# Convolution

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA">Convolution</a> is a concept that's extremely hard to wrap your head around through text, and is much better explained through video.
In theory, convolution is basically just a modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur">gaussian blur</a>.
<br />
<br />
Picture a neural network that takes in an image.
Now instead of looping over each pixel individually, apply gaussian blur before processing each pixel.

<br />
This is precisely what cnns do, except, that instead of using a multiplication matrix based on the gaussian function, it used other kinds of matrices.
These matrices are called **kernels**
