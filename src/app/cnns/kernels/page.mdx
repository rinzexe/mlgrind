# Kernels

Kernels are an extremely important part of convolutional layers.
It's essential to understand how they operate, and what they do.
<br />
<br />

Different kernels are used for different purposes, examples of which are:
<br />
<pre>
-0.5    -1    -0.5
0       0      0
0.5     1      0.5
</pre>
*Detects horizontal edges*
<br />
<pre>
-0.5    0   0.5
-1      0   1
-0.5    0   0.5
</pre>
*Detects vertical edges*
<br />
<pre>
0       0.25    0
0.25    -1      0.25
0       0.25    0
</pre>
*Detects edges in all directions*

<br />
<br />
Typically, kernels aren't **pre-defined**.
They are usually randomly initalized, and then automatically learned through backpropagation.
They're stacked together in each convolutional layer to caputre different features of the input.
<br />
<br />

## Stride

Stride refers to how much the kernel moves per step.
For example, taken an 64x64 image, a kernel could only calculate every 2 pixels, reducing the output size to 32x32.
This might result in loss of important details, so use it carefully.
<br />
<br />

## Padding

Padding adds extra pixels around the edges of the input.
These are usually 0, they don't serve any function other than avoiding an error when the kernel is calculating edge pixels.
