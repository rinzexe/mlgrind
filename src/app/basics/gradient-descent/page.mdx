# Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is the base for training machine learning models.
It finds a the correlation between the input and output, then adjusts the weights of a neural network accordingly.
<br />
<br />
Its function and explanation, while it would be good to know, isn't <i>required</i> to understand the basics of machine learning.
All you really need to know that, it's a function which helps you find the right weights more effectively, without relying on luck.
It's best explained by a graph, which you can find on the gradient descent wikipedia page.
It illustrates what it does really well, that graph is the only thing you need to understand really.
