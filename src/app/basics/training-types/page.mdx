## Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
There are 3 main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
All of these are equally useful, and applicable to different tasks.
Understading these concepts is key to understanding how to apply machine learning to your projec
##Supervised Learn
Supervised learning, is at core, a way to predict an output based on an input.
In supervised learning, both the input and outputs are <i>known</i>, which is the main difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
During training, the model learns the relationship between the input and output from a sample dataset, which is used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
<br />
<br />
Supervised learning then falls into two subcategories: classification and regression.
In classification, the model learns to predict a discrete set of classes.
In turn, regression is used for predicting continuous values, for example, a value between 0 and 100.
<br />
<br />
An example of supervised learning would be: <br />
- Predicting the price of a house based on its features. (regression)<br />
- Classifying spam emails. (classification)<br />
- Predicting stock prices. (regression)<br />
<br />
## Unsupervised Learn
In contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not predict a known output, but instead, finds patterns in the input data.
An example of its usage would be clustering, where the model groups similar data points together.
This can be demonstrated by the following example:
<br />
<br />
<pre>
Cat     1
Pizza   0
Dog     1
Candy   0
Penguin 1
Panda   1
</pre>
<br />
<br />
Here, the model learned the distinctions between food and animals, and mapped the inputs accordingly.
<br />
<br />
An example of unsupervised learning would be: <br />
- Clustering customer data into consumer types based on their purchasing behavior. <br />
- Image detection, where the model detects objects in an image. <br />
- Anomaly detection in network traffic or credit card fraud detection. <br />
<br />
## Reinforcement Learn
Reinforcement learning is a special type of machine learning, in which, the model learns by interacting with an environment.
This type of learning doesn't require any kind of dataset, which is its main 'selling point' and difference to other types of learning.
<br />
<br />
In the real world however, while reinforcement learning is a very powerful, and 'fun' tool, it's not as commonly used as the other two.
Environments where reinforcement learning can be applied are often too complex for the model to learn from scratch, or too costly to train.
<br />
<br />
An example of reinforcement learning would be (note that some of these aren't practical): <br />
- Teaching an AI to play a game. <br />
- Automating trading stocks. <br />
- Teaching a robot how to walk. <br />
<br />
## Parametric, and Non-parametric Learn
On top of the three categories listed above, machine learning can also be categorized into parametric, and non-parametric learning.
Both of these categories can be applied to supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, although it is rarely used in the latter two.
<br />
<br />
These are a gray area with different sources explaining the difference in different ways, but the outline looks something like this: <br />
In parametric learning, the number of parameters is fixed and predetermined, while in non-parametric learning, the number of parameters adapts to the size of the dataset.
